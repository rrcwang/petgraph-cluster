An exercise in implementing various graph clustering algorithms over the graph library `petgraph`.

## Planned clustering algorithms:

* [ ] Correlation clustering
* [ ] ?
* [ ] LambdaCC

## TODO:

* Benchmarks, comparing:
  * NetworkX (Python)
  * LightGraphs (Julia)
  * MATLAB
  *
* Iterative optimization (find a crate that does this?)

## Notes:

* Use GraphBLAS (or similar) bindings for speed?
  * Study LEMON library implementation

## Future:
